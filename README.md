# spotdl-streamlit-gui
A web GUI for downloading music with SpotDL
# SpotDL Streamlit web GUI
This was created so that someday I can run it on my server, allowing my to download music directly to it from a web browser. 

## Instructions for running this for yourself:

Dependancies: 
+ spotdl
+ streamlit

I have spotdl installed globally on my machine. I install streamlit in a venv. 

If you use a venv, make sure to ```cd``` to the directoy you have the venv and the .py file. Then run `source .venv/bin/activate` to use it. 



1.) cd to the directory you saved the file to. 

2.) `streamlit run spotdl-streamlit-vx.x.py` 

3.) It should automatically open a browser tab. If it doesn't, enter the address that the terminal tells you to.
